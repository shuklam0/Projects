# IPL 2022

This is an analysis of Batting & Bowling performance for players in recently concluded IPL 2022. The insights are avilable here:

## Batting

Jos Buttler got the Orange Cap by scoring 800+ runs in IPL, scoring them at 150SR and a healthy Avg. But David Miller had a better impact, scoring his 400+ runs at a higher Avg and SR than Buttler. Dinesh Karthik had a similar Avg to Buttler but scored them at a much higher rate. Other notable single innings mentions are Tim David, Rashid Khan & Pat Cummins, who benefitted from his 60(15) inning.
On the other hand, Kane Williamson had a season to forget - he scored 200+ runs at a SR of less than 100.

## Bowling

Yuzi Chahal received the Purple Cap for most wickets. But Mohsin Khan had a phenomenal torunament, picking up 14 wickets with a much lower Economy & SR. Boult & Prasidh Krishna, who picked 16 & 19 wickets respectively, weren't as successful with their Economy Rates. For SRH, while Malik & Natrajan took wickets, they were quite expensive at the same time. Russell, who had a decent all-round season, would be unhappy with his Economy Rate.
